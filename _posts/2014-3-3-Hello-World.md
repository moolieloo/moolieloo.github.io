title: Recap of the Visier Tech Talk at UBC
---

A team of Visier employees visited UBC on September 16, 2019. The goal of this visit is to recruit co-op students. Visier is a business analytics solutions provider with a focus on human resources. It is currently looking to expand its business into other domains. The company's mission is simple: support decision makers who use data.

The life cycle of a project is:
1. Extraction of customer data
2. Analytic object tables
3. Business metrics and concepts
4. Charts, comparisons, stories
5. Guidebooks & benchmarks
6. Solutions (the platform that the customer actually sees)

Visier mainly hires developers for co-op, but there is one data science co-op avaiable for the January co-op term. Visit https://www.visier.com/about/careers/students/ for more information.
